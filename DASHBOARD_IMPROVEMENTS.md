# Dashboard Improvements Documentation

## Overview
The dashboard has been significantly improved to address multiple functionality and user experience issues. This document outlines all the changes made and how to set up the environment properly.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. API Base URL Configuration Error ✅
**Problem**: Dashboard was using incorrect API URLs (`http://localhost:4000/api/analytics/...`)
**Solution**: 
- Fixed baseURL to `http://localhost:4000` (without `/api` suffix)
- Updated API calls to use `/api/analytics/...` paths
- Added proper environment variable support

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling ✅
**Problem**: Generic error messages without proper debugging
**Solution**: 
- Added comprehensive error handling for different HTTP status codes
- Detailed error logging with request/response information
- Automatic logout on 401 authentication failures
- User-friendly error messages based on error type
- Retry functionality for failed requests

### 3. Improved Data Structure and Type Safety ✅
**Problem**: No TypeScript interfaces for API responses
**Solution**: 
- Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces in `/types/dashboard.ts`
- Added proper typing for analytics data, notifications, and user data
- Enhanced data validation and error prevention

### 4. Interactive Quick Action Buttons ✅
**Problem**: Static, non-functional quick action buttons
**Solution**: 
- Added click handlers with proper navigation logic
- Interactive feedback with toast notifications
- Prepared structure for future feature implementation
- Improved accessibility with proper ARIA labels

### 5. Enhanced Loading States ✅
**Problem**: Generic loading spinner for all states
**Solution**: 
- Created custom `AnalyticsCardSkeleton` component
- Replaced generic spinners with skeleton loading
- Better visual feedback during data loading
- Improved perceived performance

### 6. Robust WebSocket Connection ✅
**Problem**: Basic WebSocket setup without error handling
**Solution**: 
- Added reconnection logic with configurable attempts
- Proper error handling for connection issues
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful disconnection cleanup
- Token-based authentication for WebSocket

### 7. Environment Configuration Setup ✅
**Problem**: Missing environment configuration
**Solution**: 
- Created `.env.example` with proper variables
- Added documentation for environment setup
- Support for both API and WebSocket URLs

## Environment Setup

### Required Environment Variables
Create `.env.local` in `/apps/web/` with:

```bash
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:4000

# WebSocket Configuration  
NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL=ws://localhost:4000

# App Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME=Matrus
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_VERSION=1.0.0
```

## New Features Added

### 1. Enhanced Analytics Display
- **Cards Mastered**: Shows user's learned cards count
- **Study Sessions**: Displays recent session activity
- **Total Users**: Platform-wide user statistics
- **Retention**: User streak and engagement metrics

### 2. Real-time Notifications
- WebSocket-based notification system
- Real-time progress updates
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Notification panel with unread indicators

### 3. Improved Error Recovery
- Automatic retry functionality
- Clear error messages based on failure type
- Graceful fallbacks for network issues
- Authentication error handling with auto-logout

### 4. Better Loading Experience
- Skeleton loading for analytics cards
- Proper loading states for different sections
- Visual feedback for user actions
- Improved perceived performance

## API Integration

### Analytics Endpoints Used:
- `GET /api/analytics/progress?userId={id}` - User learning progress
- `GET /api/analytics/activity?userId={id}` - Study session activity  
- `GET /api/analytics/global-stats` - Platform statistics
- `GET /api/analytics/retention?userId={id}` - User retention metrics

### WebSocket Events:
- `notification` - Real-time notifications
- `progressUpdate` - Live progress updates
- `joinUserRoom` - User-specific room subscription
